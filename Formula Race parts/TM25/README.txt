Description of project:
All parts within this file are components to the drivetrain for toronto metropolitain universities
formula race team, specifically for the drivetrain subsystem. 

The drivetrain system was designed to follow a set of rules given by FSAE, specifically following the
pertaining to electrical vehicles.

For the motor mounts, FEA was done on the parts to check the factor of safety and the amount of 
deflection the part would go through while being faced with the full power of the motor we are 
using for this years car. Once the initial FEA was complete, weight savings were done on the
part, and FEA would be conducted once again.
